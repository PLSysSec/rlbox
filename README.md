# RLBox API

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/PLSysSec/rlbox_sandboxing_api.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/PLSysSec/rlbox_sandboxing_api)

[![Tests](https://github.com/PLSysSec/rlbox_sandboxing_api/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/PLSysSec/rlbox_sandboxing_api/actions/workflows/cmake.yml)

RLBox sandboxing API (in C++ 17). This code has been tested on 64-bit versions of Ubuntu, Mac OSX and Windows.

## Reporting security bugs

If you find a security bug, please do not create a public issue. Instead, file a security bug on bugzilla using the [following template link](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/enter_bug.cgi?component=Security%3A%20RLBox&defined_groups=1&groups=core-security&product=Core&bug_type=defect).

## Using this library

RLBox is a general purpose sandboxing API that can be used to interact with library sandboxed with different backends --- WebAssembly, Native Client, libraries running in a separate process etc. Support for each backend is provided by a separate plugin that must also be downloaded separately.

See the [online docs](https://docs.rlbox.dev) for more details.

The RLBox library is a header only library, so you can directly download this repo and use include the contents of `code/include/` in your application. On Linux/Mac machines, you can optionally install the headers as well with `make install`.

Support for cmake's `find_package` API is also included. See the example in `examples/hello-world-cmake`.

## Running the tests

1. Setup a build folder and then build.

   ```bash
   cmake -S . -B ./build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   cmake --build ./build --parallel --config Release
   ```

2. To test (for Ubuntu, Mac or Windows):

   ```bash
   cd build
   cmake -E env LSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=../leak_suppressions.txt UBSAN_OPTIONS=suppressions=../ub_suppressions.txt ctest -V

   ```

Currently rlbox has been tested and should work with gcc-7 or later and clang-5, Visual Studio 2019 (possibly previous versions as well) or later.
If you are using other compilers/compiler versions (like mingw), these may also be supported.
Simply run the test suite and check that everything passes.

## Using/Building docs

You can view the pre-built docs checked in to the repo in the docs folder.
Alternatively, you can build these yourself with the steps [here](https://github.com/PLSysSec/rlbox_sandboxing_api/blob/master/docs.md).

## Contributing Code/Docs

1. To contribute code, it is recommended you install clang-tidy which the build
uses if available. Install using:

   On Ubuntu:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install clang-tidy
   ```

   On Arch Linux:

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S clang-tidy
   ```

2. It is recommended you use the dev mode for building during development. This
treat warnings as errors, enables clang-tidy checks, runs address sanitizer etc.
Also, you probably want to use the debug build. To do this, adjust your build
settings as shown below

   ```bash
   cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DDEV=ON -S . -B ./build
   cmake --build ./build --parallel --config Debug
   ```

3. After making changes to the source, add any new required tests and run all
tests (as described earlier).

4. Modify the docs as appropriate and rebuild docs as described earlier.
Rebuilding is required if you have added new APIs.

5. To make sure all code/docs are formatted with, we use clang-format.
Install using:

   On Ubuntu:

   ```bash
   sudo apt install clang-format
   ```

   On Arch Linux:

   ```bash
   sudo pacman -S clang-format
   ```

6. Format code with the format-source target:

   ```bash
   cmake --build ./build --target format-source
   ```

7. Submit the pull request.
